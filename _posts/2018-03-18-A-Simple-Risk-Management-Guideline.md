I recently picked up a guideline from the book, “The Top 10 Distinctions Between Millionaires and the Middle Class”. It is particularly helpful when it comes to making tough decisions. Ask yourself the following 3 questions:

1. What's the best possible outcome?
2. What could be the worst case?
3. What's the most likely outcome?

You should give it a try if you can handle the worst scenario and the most likely outcome leads you closer to your goal. On the contrary, if you can not deal with the worst possible outcome or what's most likely to happen strays you away from your goal, then you should definitely consider giving up.

Some easy Googling reveals that such a framework has also seen its place in evaluating high-stakes surgical decisions. For example, in [this article](https://shareddecisions.mayoclinic.org/2017/05/02/a-case-of-the-best-worst-and-most-likely/).
